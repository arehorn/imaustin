## 2024-04-26 - [Add input validation and length limits to /api/contact]
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/contact` endpoint did not enforce type checks (allowing arrays/objects to bypass string methods) or length limits, and lacked a null check on the parsed request body, which could lead to a 500 error if `body` was null.
**Learning:** API endpoints handling JSON payloads must validate the type and structure of the input before processing, especially before using string-specific methods like `.replace()`.
**Prevention:** Always implement rigorous input validation, including type checking, null checks, and reasonable length constraints, for all incoming data to prevent application-layer DoS and unhandled exceptions.
