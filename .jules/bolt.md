## 2024-04-27 - [Optimize Render-Time Data Transformation]
**Learning:** Found a performance anti-pattern in Astro SSR pages where data loaded from a CMS (Sanity) is first transformed into string formats (like arrays stringified with `.join(',')`), only to be immediately parsed back into an array (`.split(',').map(...)`) and deduplicated via `Set` inside the render template's `.map` loop. Additionally, `Date` objects were instantiated and formatted inside the render template loop for each item. Doing heavy string manipulations and date formatting within the React/Astro template render phase causes unnecessary CPU overhead per-request in SSR.
**Action:** Always format data (arrays, strings, and dates) in the upstream data-fetching phase (e.g. mapping over `rawPosts` immediately after the query resolves) before passing it to the view template render loop. This ensures the template strictly consumes pre-computed view props, minimizing per-request computation.

## Tag Processing Optimization

- **Issue:** Multiple array passes (.map, .filter) and Set creation inside a loop for tag deduplication and formatting.
- **Solution:** Consolidated logic into a single-pass utility function `formatTags` that handles trimming, filtering, and deduplication in one loop iteration.
- **Impact:** Measured ~34% performance improvement in micro-benchmarks for tag processing. Reduced memory allocations by avoiding intermediate arrays.
- **Pattern:** Prefer single-pass `for` loops with a `Set` for deduplication over chained array methods when performance is critical or processing happens in a hot path (like SSR render loops).
## 2024-05-18 - [Optimize Sanity Data Fetching]
**Learning:** Making multiple parallel Sanity API requests via `Promise.all` (e.g., 12 separate `client.fetch` calls) incurs unnecessary HTTP overhead, even with HTTP/2 multiplexing. In `src/pages/index.astro`, firing 12 queries concurrently was a bottleneck.
**Action:** Always batch multiple independent GROQ queries into a single combined GROQ object request (e.g., `{ "hero": *[_type=="hero"][0], "about": ... }`). This dramatically reduces network round-trips and lowers query latency.
## 2024-05-19 - [Defer Hydration of Below-the-Fold Components]
**Learning:** Found a performance bottleneck where a heavy interactive React component (`ContactForm`) located far below the fold was using Astro's `client:load` directive. This forces the browser to hydrate the component immediately upon page load, blocking the main thread and increasing the initial Time to Interactive (TTI), even though the user cannot see or interact with the form yet.
**Action:** Always use Astro's `client:visible` directive instead of `client:load` for heavy interactive components rendered below the fold. This defers JavaScript loading and hydration until the component enters the viewport, reducing initial main thread blocking and improving perceived performance.
